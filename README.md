# Server Health Check

A lightweight tool for weekly health reports from Ubuntu servers.

The initial scope is APT update availability and reboot status, with email delivery. Each server will send a weekly report, even when no action is required.

The tool will not install package updates or reboot servers.

## Status

Early development. Configuration initialization is available; health checks and
email delivery are not implemented yet.

## Usage

From the project directory on an Ubuntu server:

```sh
./bin/server-health-check --help
sudo ./bin/server-health-check init
```

The `init` command creates `/etc/server-health-check.conf` from the example with
root-only access. If the path already exists, it stops without changing it.
Edit the created file to set your server name and email credentials. Keep real
credentials outside the repository.

For a project installed at `/opt/server-health-check`, create a command shortcut:

```sh
sudo ln -s /opt/server-health-check/bin/server-health-check /usr/local/bin/server-health-check
```

Then run `server-health-check --help` or `sudo server-health-check init` from any
directory.
